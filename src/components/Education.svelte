            I graduated in Computer Engineering at one of the leading universities in Hungary, BME. My education included mathematics,
            object oriented and functional programming, design principles and IT architectures.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got to know to several programming languages, including <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>,
            <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Kotlin</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Dart</strong>
            and
            <strong>Erlang</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose Software Development to become my main specialization. During these years I studied OO programming and visual
            informatics on a higher level. I took several courses on 3D programming and modelling. My thesis was a <strong>Flutter</strong> based
            serverless mobile application with 3D features.
        </p>
        <p>That was the very moment I fell in love with the development of mobile apps.</p>
